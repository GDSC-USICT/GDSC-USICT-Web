- Avoid inline styling

## Find an issue ( or make one ) :

- **Note :** Every change in this project should have an associated issue ( very small changes can be an exception but it's still recommended to have an issue for you change ).
- You can also skip this step if the contribution is small ( obvious fixes or typos ) and directly create a PR with the required changes.
- Take a look at the [Existing Issues](hhttps://github.com/GDSC-USICT/GDSC-USICT-Web/issues) or create your [**own** Issue](https://github.com/GDSC-USICT/GDSC-USICT-Web/issues/new/choose) if you don't find any that tickle your fancy.
- Show your interest by commenting on the issue you want to work on and the maintainers will assign you the issue.


## Labels
Labels can help you find an issue you'd like to help with.

- The `help wanted` label is for problems or updates that anyone in the community can start working on.
- The `good first` issue label is for problems or updates we think are ideal for beginners.

## Work on the issue assigned
- Make sure the changes follow our [**Project Conventions**](https://github.com/GDSC-USICT/GDSC-USICT-Web/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#project-conventions)
- Keep your commits clean.
- when syncing your fork, consider [rebasing](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) the changes on top of yours instead of creating a merge commit for the same.
- Make sure to update the documentation accordingly (if required).

## Pull Request

- Go to your fork and create a pull request from there.
- Wait for it to be reviewed and merge by the maintainers/moderators.
- Celebrate :tada:
